Reaction catalysed:
ATP + a protein = ADP + a phosphoprotein.
Comments:

    Activation of cyclin-dependent kinases requires association of the enzyme with a regulatory subunit referred to as a cyclin.
    It is the sequential activation and inactivation of cyclin-dependent kinases, through the periodic synthesis and destruction of cyclins, that provides the primary means of cell-cycle regulation.
    Formerly EC 2.7.1.37.
